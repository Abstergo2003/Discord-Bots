To activate nsfw addon use /nsfw\n   - 1 new channel will be craeted:\n      -nsfw - same as spotted\n      - works just the same\n   - role nsfw-spotter will be created, whith this role peaople are able to see nsfw channel\n   - you will get logs from nsfw channel\n4. To ensure bot working perfectly don't change his permissions\n5. You can use /cl command to delete bulk messages from spotted and nsfw channels\n6. I reccomend manual back up of spotted channels\n7. /rc command recreates spotted infrastructure (doesnt restore messages)(in case of admin betrayal)\n","fields":[],"author":"","authorUrl":"","authorIcon":"","footerText":"","footerIconUrl":""}],"reply":true,"ephemeral":false,"tts":false,"overwrite":false,"dontSend":false,"editMessage":"0","editMessageVarName":"","storage":"0","varName2":"","name":"Send Message"},{"roleName":"troll","hoist":"true","mentionable":"true","color":"","position":"","storage":"1","varName":"role","reason":"","name":"Create Role"},{"roleName":"verified","hoist":"false","mentionable":"true","color":"","position":"","storage":"1","varName":"role2","reason":"","name":"Create Role"},{"channel":"3","varName":"spotted","role":"3","varName2":"role","permission":"VIEW_CHANNEL","state":"2","reason":"","name":"Set Role Channel Perms"},{"storage":"1","varName":"channelss","changeType":"0","value":"\"0-spotted-logs\"","name":"Control Variable"},{"storage":"1","varName":"channelss","separator":"-","storage2":"2","varName2":"channels-list","name":"Convert Text to List"},{"storage":"2","varName":"channels-list","name":"Save Variable"}]},{"name":"message","temp":"","event-type":"4","_id":"NKFXQ","actions":[{"list":"0","varName":"","tempVarName":"user","type":"true","actions":[{"channel":"5","varName":"user","message":"","buttons":[],"selectMenus":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[{"title":"Hello","url":"","color":"","timestamp":"true","imageUrl":"","thumbUrl":"","description":"This server contains spotted infrastructure!!!\nStick to te rule and every one will be happy!!!\nRules are simple:\n1.
